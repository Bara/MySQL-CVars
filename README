### Short description
Control cvars over mysql.

### Description
I don't care about criticism (only for bugs/ideas) about this plugin.

With this plugin you can control all cvars over a mysql table (webinterface isn't planned by me). If mysql down/unreachable -> all last known cvars are saved in a backup file.
